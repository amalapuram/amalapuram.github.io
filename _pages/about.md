I am **Suresh Kumar Amalapuram**,  currently working with the [Prof. Mahesh Marina](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mmarina/) as a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh. Previously, I was a Postdoc with [Prof. Siva Ram Murthy](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~murthy/). Prior to that I received Ph.D. student from Computer Science and Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad, advised jointly by [Prof. Bheemarjuna Reddy Tamma](https://people.iith.ac.in/tbr/) and [Prof. Sumohana S Channappayya](https://people.iith.ac.in/sumohana/).  

My Ph.D. research centers on the intersection of security and continual learning. Specifically, I am developing security systems that can continuously learn and adapt to novel cyber threats. These systems address challenges such as class imbalance, scalability, concept drift, and limited supervision. 

Previously, I was a software developer at Oracle India Pvt ltd, Bangalore for three years, and completed post-graduation in computer science from IIT Kharagpur
