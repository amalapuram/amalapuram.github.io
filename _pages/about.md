I am **Suresh Kumar Amalapuram**, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad, advised jointly by [Prof. Bheemarjuna Reddy Tamma](https://people.iith.ac.in/tbr/) and [Prof. Sumohana S Channappayya](https://people.iith.ac.in/sumohana/).  

My Ph.D. research centers on the intersection of security and continual learning. Specifically, I am developing security systems that can continuously learn and adapt to novel cyber threats. These systems address challenges such as class imbalance, scalability, concept drift, and limited supervision. 

Previously, I was a software developer at Oracle India Pvt ltd, Bangalore for three years, and completed post-graduation in computer science from IIT Kharagpur
